    <div><p style="color:green;">The beige hue on the waters of the loch impressed all, including the French queen, before she heard that symphony again, just as young Arthur wanted</p></div>
    <div><p style="color:blue;">The pleasure of Shawn’s company
    Is what I most enjoy.
    He put a tack on Ms. Yancey’s chair
    When she called him a horrible boy.
    At the end of the month he was flinging two kittens
    Across the width of the room.
    I count on his schemes to show me a way now
    Of getting away from my gloom.</p></div>
    <div><p style="color:red;">Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the store: Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick
    slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for
    the kids. She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.</p></div>
