        He put a tack on Ms. Yancey's chair when she called him a horrible boy.
        At the end of the month he was flinging two kittens across the width of the room.
        I count on his schemes to show me a way now of getting away from my gloom.</p>

        Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick
        slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy
        frog for
        the kids. She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train
        station.</p>
